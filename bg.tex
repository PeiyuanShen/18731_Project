In this section, we give an overview of one of the most popular web application
framework, Spring~\cite{spring+security:home}, and review prior work related to
our projects.

\subsection{Spring}

Spring~\cite{spring+security:home} is said to be the most popular Java web
application framework.
%
The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control
container for the Java platform.
%
Spring Security~\cite{spring+security:method} is a powerful authentication and
access-control framework, which is the standard for securing Spring-based
applications.
%
Spring security provides comprehensive and extensible support for both
authentication and authorization, and prevents attacks like session fixation,
clickjacking, etc.

\subsection{Java Program Analysis}

An access control policy is an expressive specification of what resources can be accessed, by whom, and under what conditions. Bakers \etal~\cite{Backes+etal:2018:Zelkova} presents a formalization of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) policy language  that lets users govern access to AWS resources. This paper also presents an analysis tool, ZELKOVA, for verifying policy properties.

Doop~\cite{Bravenboer:2009:Doop} is a framework for Java pointer and taint
analysis.
%
Doop specifies pointer analysis algorithms declaratively using Datalog: a
logic-based language for defining recursive relations.
%
At its core, Doop is a collection of various analyses expressed in the form of
Datalog rules.

Antoniadis \etal~\cite{Antoniadis+etal:2020:Java} in 2020 proposed a static
analysis framework called JackEE for Java Application, and introduced a
sound-modulo-analysis model of Java HashMap to improve precision and
scalability. JackEE can analyze both Servlets and Spring APIs. JackEE is also
evaluated through realistic benchmarks. It is proved to have a higher
reachability than some other popular tools like Doop~\footnote{Publicly
  available at: http://doop.program-analysis.org/.}.
  
Rather than taking a specification of this logic as input, RoleCast \etal~\cite{10.1145/2048066.2048146} is a first system capable of statically identifying security logic that mediates security-sensitive events in Web applications. It identifies security-critical variables and applies role-specific variable consistency analysis to find missing security checks. RoleCast performs well for PHP and JSP applications. This paper also demonstrated examples of bad security policies.

Benjamin \etal~\cite{inproceedings} proposes a technique, called EventScope to extend the vulnerability identification to SDN \cite{6994333}. EventScope automatically analyzes SDN control plane event usage, discovers candidate vulnerabilities based on missing event-handling routines, and validates vulnerabilities based on data plane effects.
